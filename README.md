## Data Analysis and Visualization of Indian Car Dataset

*Project Overview:*
I undertook a comprehensive data analysis project involving an extensive dataset of Indian cars. The dataset consisted of 141 columns, encapsulating a wide range of features from car specifications to performance metrics. The primary goal was to uncover meaningful insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and to visualize the findings using advanced Python libraries.

*Key Tasks and Techniques:*
1. *Data Cleaning and Preparation:*
   - Ensured data quality by handling missing values, converting data types, and addressing inconsistencies.
   - Filtered and categorized data for focused analysis, such as segmenting cars by body type and price segments.

2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):*
   - Performed univariate and bivariate analysis to identify trends and correlations within the data.
   - Utilized statistical measures to summarize key attributes like price, mileage, and features.

3. *Visualization:*
   - Created detailed visualizations using libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib.
   - Implemented various plot types including box plots, joint plots, and count plots to effectively communicate insights.
   - Example visualizations include:
     - *Affordable vs Price (in log)*: Illustrated the relationship between car affordability and ex-showroom price.
     - *Fuel Type vs Mileage*: Compared the mileage performance across different fuel types.
     - *Body Type vs Doors*: Examined the distribution of the number of doors among various body types.
     - *Wheel Size vs Minimum Turning Radius*: Analyzed how wheel size impacts the car's turning radius.

*Key Insights:*
- Identified that certain body types, such as SUVs and Sedans, typically have higher ex-showroom prices.
- Observed significant variations in mileage performance among different fuel types, with electric cars outperforming others.
- Found a correlation between larger wheel sizes and a greater minimum turning radius, indicating maneuverability constraints.

*Technologies Used:*
- *Programming Language*: Python
- *Libraries*: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- *Tools*: Jupyter Notebook
